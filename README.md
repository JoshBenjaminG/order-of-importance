# ROAD MAP : What you need to know

In order of importance. _Please_ help us make this the best list it can be. Maybe we'll make it a JSON thing later - or somehow use it for the PHP or JS lessons later, but for now: Markdown.

The big-picture [success checklist](https://perpetual.education/resources/success-checklist/) already exists. That includes things like your attitude etc., - but here is a more concrete list of things that you can do to PROVE your abilities to yourself.

We expect most of these to point to the projects that are already in the DFTW curriculumn but that we can also suggest more projects too.

These things are the things you need to know. When you're learning so many things - it can be tricky to stay centered. So, here's a list. We're going to try our best to give you ways to prove your understanding of these - but if we don't: It's your job to make sure you feel confident with this. Figure out a way to prove it to _yourself_. That's when you'll _really_ **know** you know it. If all else fails, practice. And ask for help to see things from a different prospective that might click.

If you are taking a hard-line towards UX or programming specifically, then some of these might not apply to you after their introductions.


## **GOALS**

- Collect a concise list of concepts and associated projects to act as a road map

- Students can fork the repo and use it as an optional resume piece

- This might be a bit long-winded as we (derek in this case) writes it - but hopefully we can keep it really clear and simple

## ⬤ Basics

### The general names and scopes of the various computer equipment and software you are using

This might seem simple, but the reason it is so important is because the mental models for this will be foundational as you move forward. Can you explain how a basic computer works, what inputs and outputs there are, how those control the software, and how the system sends and receives messages? As with most things on this list: you just need to know enough to discuss the subject and be effective.

### How to maintain your file structure and organize your work station

This is something you'll always be maintaining and building on. If your files and your workflow is a mess, people will notice - and they'll take you less seriously. You'll take longer to do things - and it's just very telling when someone is too stubborn to adapt and try new things. This includes how your directory structures are setup, iCloud, Drive, spaces, and also how you use keyboard short-cuts. It might seem like _personal preference_ - and it is. If you are choosing to be a mess, then - we'll know that your personal preference is to be slow an inefficient for no good reason.

## ⬤ Mindset

### Something about data structures in daily life

Detailed outlines/drawings. [human-data-collection](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-data-collection/) and [human-memory](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-memory/) lessons could spark some ideas.

## ⬤ HTML and CSS

We learn a bunch of stuff later in the course about HTML / so, we'll note that further down. But if you are revisiting these projects later - then you should totally incorperate those ideas here.

### How to traverse the file structure with the OS, the command line, and have a clear understanding of file paths and how to link HTML documents and images etc.

This might seem _basic_ but we see students (and even senior devs) just guessing and trying `../` or `./` until it works and moving on. This is not reasonable. If the web it a complex system of linked resources, then you absolutely have to have a solid handle on how to link things together and how file paths work and how to write them. And it will become more complicated later. This is the basic version.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev) (one of the early challenges) (maybe we should make another slightly more edge-case filled challenge) (but also / most any semi-complex site should prove you've got this)

### How to write the HTML and CSS for a really beautiful article

We're talking beautiful for all readers. That means robot web crawlers, screen-readers and all the web reading technologies.

Why it's important and how you know you for sure know it
