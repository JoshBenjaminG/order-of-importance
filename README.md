# ROAD MAP : What you need to know

In order of importance. _Please_ help us make this the best list it can be. Maybe we'll make it a JSON thing later - or somehow use it for the PHP or JS lessons later, but for now: Markdown.

The big-picture [success checklist](https://perpetual.education/resources/success-checklist/) already exists. That includes things like your attitude etc., - but here is a more concrete list of things that you can do to PROVE your abilities to yourself.

There's this other Quora answer Derek wrote - that also has the order of things [here](https://perpetual.education/in-what-order-should-i-learn-design-and-development-for-the-web/)

We expect most of these to point to the projects that are already in the DFTW curriculum but that we can also suggest more projects too.

These things are the things you need to know. When you're learning so many things - it can be tricky to stay centered. So, here's a list. We're going to try our best to give you ways to prove your understanding of these - but if we don't: It's your job to make sure you feel confident with this. Figure out a way to prove it to _yourself_. That's when you'll _really_ **know** you know it. If all else fails, practice. And ask for help to see things from a different prospective that might click.

If you are taking a hard-line towards UX or programming specifically, then some of these might not apply to you after their introductions.


## **GOALS**

- Collect a concise list of concepts and associated projects to act as a road map

- Students can fork the repo and use it as an optional resume piece

- This might be a bit long-winded as we (derek in this case) writes it - but hopefully we can then edit it down and keep it clear and simple

## ⬤ Basics

### The general names and scopes of the various computer equipment and software you are using

This might seem simple, but the reason it is so important is because the mental models for this will be foundational as you move forward. Can you explain how a basic computer works, what inputs and outputs there are, how those control the software, and how the system sends and receives messages? As with most things on this list: you just need to know enough to discuss the subject and be effective.

- [ ] Done [link to quiz](https://peprojects.dev) (This should probably be one of the practice interview questions)


### How to maintain your file structure and organize your work station

This is something you'll always be maintaining and building on. If your files and your workflow is a mess, people will notice - and they'll take you less seriously. You'll take longer to do things - and it's just very telling when someone is too stubborn to adapt and try new things. This includes how your directory structures are setup, iCloud, Drive, spaces, and also how you use keyboard short-cuts. It might seem like _personal preference_ - and it is. If you are choosing to be a mess, then - we'll know that your personal preference is to be slow an inefficient for no good reason.

- [ ] Done (not sure how to check this yet) (maybe we make a follow along video)


## ⬤ Mindset

### Something about data structures in daily life

Detailed outlines/drawings. [human-data-collection](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-data-collection/) and [human-memory](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-memory/) lessons could spark some ideas.

- [ ] Done

### Write about your learning journey and process

We think you should be writing about your process and learning experience. We can't make you do it, but we know that if you do - you'll learn more, make better work, understand the process more - and make a lot more money. You can always go back and edit your posts later.

## ⬤ HTML and CSS

We learn a bunch of stuff later in the course about HTML / so, we'll note that further down. But if you are revisiting these projects later - then you should totally incorporate those ideas here.

### How to traverse the file structure with the OS, the command line, and have a clear understanding of file paths and how to link HTML documents and images etc.

This might seem _basic_ but we see students (and even senior devs) just guessing and trying `../` or `./` until it works and moving on. This is not reasonable. If the web it a complex system of linked resources, then you absolutely have to have a solid handle on how to link things together and how file paths work and how to write them. And it will become more complicated later. This is the basic version.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev) (one of the early challenges) (maybe we should make another slightly more edge-case filled challenge) (but also / most any semi-complex site should prove you've got this)

### How to write the HTML and CSS for a really beautiful article

We're talking beautiful for all readers. That means robot web crawlers, screen-readers and all the web reading technologies. Semantic HTML elements. An article (like this one here) - is essentially a data-structure, right? For the most part all of these elements are naturally responsive to the view-port. 

Which units do you use for what? Why?

Some companies like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [SubStack](https://substack.com/) are 100% reliant on a great typography system. It may seem trivial - but it's not. People get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year - to just think about _this_.

Also a good time to use an HTML validator or run a lighthouse test.

This is a great time to do user testing. You can ask your friends and family. If the article is really enjoyable to read, then you can iterate. If it's not A+ then it's not done.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

You can make many different article styles. And this will clearly extend to all future projects, right?


### A basic business-card style website

This can really be 1 page. It needs to say who you are, what you are doing, why we would care, and how to contact you. You can link to your newsletter. You can have more than one page. It should look "good" - leaving no reason to doubt your sense of taste.

You can have someone else help with fonts and spacing if that is hard. Simple and functional and publicly available.

Being able to pair down and really understand basic legibility and content - shows a lot more about you than programming will. It's hard. But it'll get easier if you try it.

We also suggest you get your [**/goals** and **/resume** pages](https://perpetual.education/exercises/goals-and-resume-pages/) going early.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

This should be changing many many times throughout the course. But if you ever get lost - you can always come back to this state.

(Simple + done) > complex and broken or unfinished.

This also assumes that it's up on the web with FTP etc.

Again: you can test this with people. It should be a unanimous success or it's not successful.

**Things this could help prove:**

- Should respond to all view-port size and have solid type choices
- You know how to employ images / and ensure they are the right size
- You can use the dev tools to gauge performance on a basic level
- Validation / and basic accessibility
- if you are revisiting this 
	- then extra accessibility testing
	- dark mode / contrast checks


### Understanding metadata

You should be well acquainted with rich social sharing assets and why that is helpful for everyone.

What happens if there is no metadata? What are all of the options?

Even if you aren't planning on being a _graphic designer_ - you're still going to need to know how to crop images and prepare them for things like this. This also touches on _content strategy_ and SEO.

You could make a series of examples and test them. You could write a post about various options.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

- if you are revisiting this later
	- you could look into structured data
	- site maps


### Basic graphic creation

We know that not everyone _wants_ to make graphics. But everyone should at least know how to use the shapes and combine them and subtract them and use a graphics program to copy a simple logo or amend a graphic you are given.

You should know how to use the tools enough to say "Yes. I've used the graphics programs and can open up files and work with them and export them." (even if you never end up doing that at work - it will help you get the job)

What can you do? Create your own logo. Create some graphics for your blog posts. Create some thumbnails for your projects. Or do one of the exercises like this [thing-a-day](https://perpetual.education/exercises/thing-a-day/)

Around this time is the website structure challenge

We could make a more advanced challenge for that ^.

### MILESTONE-01: https://peprojects.dev/milestones/early-html

Here are all of the things that students are expected to understand in depth at this point. They have the skills to look at the code - and everything should be clear. At this point there is a small set of elements and uses. So, if anything here isn't clear - then we should go over that in detail. And there probably needs to be a lot more practice.
